### Performance Task

This README exists for this project that I've been assigned for AP Computer Science Principles.
Therefore, files in this repos will be highly dynamic and such changes will be noted.
In addition, this README will be tailored so that it supports/explains the requirements and nuances of the APCSP Performance Task guidelines.
